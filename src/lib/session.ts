// own subset — either way you come back to the same end-of-round screen. When
// you hit COMPLETE ROUND a rest starts. When it ends you run THE SAME WHOLE
// SESSION again — not just the bits you retried — and it repeats until you say
// you're done.

// TWO NUMBERS, NOT A DOUBLING RULE
// ================================
// The first rest is 5 minutes and every rest after it is 10. Those are two
// plain settings the user types, NOT `first × 2` and not a curve. The user was
// explicit: they do not want to configure an algorithm, they want to type 5
// and 10. `restMinutes` below is the whole rule and it is four lines.
//
// THE REST IS A TIMESTAMP, NOT A PROCESS
// ======================================
// `restUntil` is an absolute ms timestamp written once when the round
// completes. Nothing runs. Close the tab, come back tomorrow, and the rest is
// simply over — the same read of the same number gives the same answer. A rest
// timer that broke when you closed the tab would be a bug; this one cannot
// have that bug, because there is nothing alive to break. Leaving during a
// rest is free: nothing is in flight.

 *   - clean means clean: landed with no miss in this leg. Getting there on the
 *     second attempt of the retry is not "you got it back", and pretending

/**
 * What the round-complete screen shows — deliberately fed from TWO sources,
 * and the whole point of this function is to keep them from being confused.
 *
 * - `selection` is the FULL drill: `session.facts`, frozen at session start and
 *   never shrunk to what you reached. It is what "Pick what to retry" offers,
 *   so ending a round early (answered 1 of 9) still lets you pick any of the 9.
 *   See the field doc on `StudySession.facts`: retry legs narrow the leg, never
 *   the session, so this is the full selection in every leg.
 *
 * - `answered`, `total`, `firstTry` and `needAnother` describe the round you
 *   actually PLAYED: the facts in `roundStats`. The header counts these because
 *   they are honest about what happened — the items you never reached were not
 *   "missed," and inflating the header to the full selection would claim a
 *   round you didn't run.
 *
 * THE HEADER COUNTS SHOWINGS, AND THAT IS WHY IT ADDS UP
 * ======================================================
 * It used to count FACTS, all three of them, and still printed a line that read
 * as arithmetic: "5 questions · 4 right first try · 2 missed". Six from five.
 * `total` was unique facts, `firstTry` was the per-round FLAG (`firstTryCorrect`
 * — one fact, one vote) and `missed` was `missedInRound`, which counts a fact
 * that was fine cold and fumbled on a later leg. Three different questions, one
 * sentence, no denominator any of them shared.
 *
 * All three are now SHOWINGS, the unit task 03 settled on:
 *
 *     total       = Σ seen              every question the round asked
 *     firstTry    = Σ firstTryShowings  the ones you landed cold, via first-try.ts
 *     needAnother = total - firstTry    by construction, so the line sums
 *
 * `needAnother` is a subtraction and not its own tally on purpose: a third
 * independent count is exactly how the first line stopped adding up. It is also
 * why it is not called "missed" — a hint-assisted answer and a second-attempt
 * answer both land in it, and neither is a miss. It says what it counts.
 *
 * A leg adds showings to the round, so retrying moves these numbers. That is
 * finding 1's fix in its cheapest form: a perfect retry raises `total` and
 * `firstTry` together and the header cannot look identical afterwards.
 *
 * `missed` is the misses of the answered round (`missedInRound`), unchanged and
 * still historical: you did miss these, and a later leg does not get to edit
 * that. `recovered` and `outstanding` split it by what is still TRUE NOW, and
 * `outstanding` is what the picker offers.
